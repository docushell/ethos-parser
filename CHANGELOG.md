# Changelog

All notable changes to ethos-engine. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

This project is pre-release and has no published versions. Entries are grouped by **milestone**
(`docs/05-MILESTONES.md`) rather than by version number, because a milestone is the unit of work
that has acceptance criteria.

## [Unreleased]

### M3 — Extract: text runs, native locators, fail-closed operators, synthesized flags

Position-aware text runs whose origins are trustworthy, whose boxes are measured or typed-absent,
and whose parse stops rather than silently dropping content.

**Added — `engine-pdf`**

- `ops` — all **73** operators of PDF 32000-1 Table A.1 as an enum. Dispatch is an exhaustive
  match with **no wildcard arm**: adding a variant without handling it is a compile error, and a
  token outside the table is a hard error naming it. Operators that do not move a glyph are
  *named* no-ops, so "we do not interpret `rg`" is a decision in the source rather than an
  accident of a `_ =>`.
- `content` — the interpreter, including all four show-text operators. **`"` and `'` are
  implemented**; `"`'s absence from pdf-inspector's match is the disqualifying defect, where text
  vanishes and adjacent runs merge with corrupt geometry while the output stays well-formed.
- `text_state` — CTM, text and line matrices, `Tc`/`Tw`/`Tz`/`TL`/`Ts`. **`Tz` multiplies the
  whole advance expression**, spacing terms included; pdf-inspector implements it nowhere.
- `fonts`, `metrics` — three independent questions per glyph (what character, how far, what box),
  because they fail independently. Conflating the last two is how `height = font_size` gets
  written.
- `cmap` — `ToUnicode` parsing (`bfchar`, `bfrange`, codespace ranges), the source of the ligature
  caveat: `<03>` → `<00660069>` is one code and two characters.
- `encoding` — `WinAnsiEncoding` in full, `StandardEncoding`'s ASCII range including the two codes
  where it is *not* ASCII (`0x27` is `quoteright`, `0x60` is `quoteleft`), and `/Differences`.
- `nodes` — `TextRun` with `PdfLocator`, `SynthesizedChar`, `scalar_code_mismatch`.
- `engine extract <pdf>` — canonical JSON, exit 0 or 2. **No exit 1**: "needs attention" is a
  classify concept, and overloading it would make a caller's `&&` chain mean two different things
  depending on which subcommand ran.

**Honesty, and where it shows**

- **Ink boxes are measured or absent.** The whole conformance corpus is standard-14 Helvetica with
  no `FontDescriptor`, so every run reports `NotReportedByReader` — the typed-absence path, proved
  on real documents rather than a mock. One engine-owned fixture carries a descriptor so the
  measured path is proved too.
- **Absent advance is absent, not zero.** A standard-14 font may omit `/Widths` and expect built-in
  AFM metrics, which this profile does not vendor. The advance is omitted from the wire; the origin
  is unaffected, because it comes from the content stream.
- **Hyphenation is not rejoined**, and that is a stated policy with a golden. Distinguishing a soft
  break-hyphen from a real compound hyphen needs a dictionary, and a rule that guesses is the
  cliff-shaped heuristic refused everywhere else. Silent rejoining is forbidden outright.
- **Reading order is stream order.** `two-columns` comes out right-column-first — visibly wrong,
  and asserted that way, because that is what `single-column-v1` means.

**Changed**

- **`skrifa` replaces `ttf-parser`**, which the milestone named. RUSTSEC-2026-0192 records that
  ttf-parser's author declared it unmaintained with no safe upgrade, and names skrifa as the
  maintained successor. Pinned to 0.39 because 0.44's tree needs Rust 1.89 and this workspace pins
  1.88.
- `Profile.cmap_data_version`: `absent-until-m3` → `annex-d-encodings-1`, naming what is actually
  carried. The pinned profile digest moved accordingly.
- The float-ban guard now matches **whole tokens**. It was matching substrings, and a sha256
  digest containing `…cf32c2e…` tripped it — a guard that cries wolf on a hash is a guard someone
  eventually disables.

**Deviation from the milestone text, stated plainly**

M3 called for vendoring ~168 Adobe `.bcmap` CMaps. They are **not** vendored. Nothing in the corpus
exercises them, they could not be obtained and verified in this pass, and committing binary data no
test touches would be worse than declaring the gap. A document naming a predefined CMap is
**refused** with a named error. The same applies to the Core-14 AFM widths and the full Adobe Glyph
List. All three are declared in `not_decoded` and explained in `vendor/README.md`.

**Not done**

- M4 capability blocks and coverage summaries; M5 `DocumentRepresentation v0` and the grounding
  projection; M6 oracle agreement.

### M2 — Classify: reason codes, two axes, three exit codes, bounded sampling

`engine-pdf` opens a PDF once and reports what it observed. No verdict, no confidence, no quality
field — the engine owns the observation, the caller owns the routing policy.

**Added**

- `engine_pdf::Document` — magic-checked, opened once, shared by every stage. M3's `extract` takes
  the same handle rather than reopening: two loads can disagree, and a classifier that saw a
  different object graph from the extractor is a silent divergence with no diagnostic.
- `engine_pdf::classify` — per-page counts, two orthogonal reason axes, a derived boolean, and
  `pages_content_scanned` as an observable bound.
- `OcrNeedReason` / `LayoutComplexityReason` — **separate types**, so `table-likely` cannot be
  constructed as an OCR-need reason. A dense financial table in crisp born-digital text needs no
  OCR at all; a single "complex" list would send it to an engine that could only make it worse.
- `engine classify <pdf>` — canonical JSON on stdout, exit 0 / 1 / 2. `extract`, `ground` and
  `grounding-check` exit 2 naming the milestone that owns them, rather than printing usage and
  exiting 0 as though the work happened.
- `docs/draft-schemas/classification.draft.json`.

**Measured, and it changed two acceptance lines**

- **`irs-form-1040-2025` is exit 1, not exit 0.** It fires `table-likely` and `dense-graphics`.
  Suppressing a true layout reason to make a doc line come out right is the tuning this project
  refuses, so the fixture choice changed: `synthetic/simple-text` is the exit-0 case, and
  `irs-form-1040` became the axis-independence case, which it serves better.
- **The 20%-total-time bound was unachievable, and the reason was informative.** The counter proved
  the page walk was already bounded — 492 pages, 8 scanned — while `lopdf` parses the whole object
  graph eagerly, so total cost is `O(parse) + O(N × per-page)`. Timing the phases separately shows
  what the claim actually is: **246× the pages for 1.7× the classify time.**

**Honesty about what is not detected**

`garbled` and `multi-column` are in the vocabulary and are **never emitted**, because no sound
detector exists for either. The artifact declares both in `not_detected` with the reason — silence
would let a caller read an empty list as evidence a document is not garbled.

`sparse-text` requires short text **alongside imagery**. LiteParse uses `text_length < 20`
unconditionally and compounds it with a vowel-frequency garble heuristic that strips items from the
tally first, so an acronym-dense page can be reported as `no-text` when its text extracted
perfectly. Neither mechanism exists here, and a test asserts `nist-sp-800-53r5` — a control
catalogue full of `AC-2`/`SC-7` — is not reported as textless.

**Changed**

- `Profile.backend.version` is now the resolved `lopdf` version, `0.44.0`, replacing
  `unbound-until-m3`. The pinned profile digest moved accordingly — the mechanism working as
  designed.
- `deny.toml` gains `BSD-3-Clause` (`lopdf` → `encoding_rs`; also the licence the vendored Adobe
  CMaps will need at M3), plus `Unlicense`, `Zlib` and `0BSD` from the same subtree. Each added in
  the PR that introduced the crate needing it.

**Not done**

- Text extraction: content-stream interpretation, CMaps, ink boxes, `NativeLocator` emit (M3). The
  classifier walks content streams to **count** operators; it decodes no text and interprets
  nothing.

### M1 — Contract types, c14n / quanta, `schema_version` on the wire

`docs/01-CONTRACT.md` is now Rust. The artifact shape stops being negotiable and starts being a
compile error.

**Added — `engine-core`**

- `c14n` — c14n v1, a clean-room implementation of the contract Ethos implements. UTF-8, no
  whitespace, keys sorted **explicitly at write time**, minimal escaping, integers only,
  idempotent. Parity vectors lifted from Ethos's committed tests prove byte compatibility without
  taking a Cargo dependency on Ethos.
- `geom` — `quantize` (round-half-away-from-zero; `NaN`/`±∞`/overflow are errors, never clamps)
  and `QRect` as `[x0, y0, x1, y1]` with construction-time validation.
- `identity` — `ArtifactIdentity`, `ArtifactBinding`, `Sha256Hex`, `CoordinateSystem`.
- `profile` — `Profile`, `Capabilities`, `BackendIdentity`, and `profile_sha256()`.
- `derivation` — `DerivationClass` and `GeometryPresence` / `GeometryAbsence`.
- `ids` — `IdAllocator`, `NodeId`, `IdKind`, `sort_ids`.
- `error` — the six-variant `EngineError` taxonomy.

**Added — docs**

- `docs/draft-schemas/` — six DRAFT JSON Schemas plus an index. Under `docs/` deliberately; there
  is still no production `schemas/` path.
- This changelog.

**Decisions worth knowing**

- **`quantize` uses `f64::round`, not Ethos's `(x + 0.5).floor()`.** That idiom double-rounds: once
  `|x| ≥ 2^52` the sum is unrepresentable and rounds *before* `floor` runs, so an exact integer
  product returns one quantum too large — and `MAX_SAFE_INT`, which the contract declares canonical,
  is refused outright. `f64::round` is IEEE `roundToIntegralTiesToAway`: same rule, computed
  exactly. Measured divergence from Ethos across an exhaustive knife-edge sweep of `[0, 2·10^6)`:
  **exactly one value**, `0.49999999999999994`, where this returns `0` (correct — it is below one
  half) and Ethos returns `1`. Unreachable from decimal text, and across all ten million
  `0.001`-step literals in `[0, 10000)` points the two agree everywhere.
- **`QRect` rejects zero-area rectangles**, which is *stricter* than Ethos, whose `QRect::new`
  rejects only `x0 > x1`. Stricter-on-emission is the only safe direction: the engine may refuse to
  emit what the oracle tolerates, never the reverse.
- **`quantize` rejects `quantum_per_point == 0`**, which would otherwise map every coordinate on
  the page to the origin and return `Ok(0)` while doing it.
- **Typed absence, not `Option<QRect>`.** `None` would collapse "could not measure", "nothing to
  measure", and "not asked to measure" into one value, and only the first is a declarable capability
  limitation.
- **`Sha256Hex` rejects uppercase hex** rather than folding it, so one digest has exactly one
  spelling and a comparison never fails for formatting reasons.
- **The default profile is pinned by test**, bytes and digest. A profile change is now a deliberate
  act — including a crate version bump, since `parser_version` is part of identity by design.
- **`Unicode-3.0` added to `deny.toml`'s allowlist.** M1 is the PR that introduced the crate needing
  it: `serde`'s `derive` feature reaches `unicode-ident`, whose licence is
  `(MIT OR Apache-2.0) AND Unicode-3.0` — the `AND` makes it non-optional. Added on introduction
  rather than in advance, which is what the prior comment asked for.

**Fixed after adversarial review**

- **Unknown-field denial now covers every nested object, not the ones someone remembered.**
  `deny_unknown_fields` is not recursive, and the first pass stopped one level short: a profile
  carrying `coordinate_system.future_knob` parsed cleanly and **re-hashed to the unmodified default
  digest** — measured — so an artifact would claim comparability with a profile it does not match.
  Now on `CoordinateSystem`, plus `ArtifactIdentity`, `ArtifactBinding` and `GeometryPresence`,
  matching the `additionalProperties: false` their draft schemas already declared. The nested test
  derives its field list from the serialized value rather than a hardcoded array, so a nested
  object added later is covered automatically.
- **`DerivationClass::may_be_overwritten_by` implemented only half of §6.** It ignored its second
  argument entirely, so it protected `Extracted` while letting `Proposed` overwrite `Computed`,
  `Recognized`, and other `Proposed` nodes — the path by which a model's suggestion quietly becomes
  the record. Both rules are now enforced and pinned by a full 4×4 matrix, plus a test asserting
  the result actually depends on the overwriter.
- `Profile` now denies unknown fields. Without it a profile from a newer engine deserialized with
  its unknown knob silently dropped, then **re-hashed to a different digest than it arrived with** —
  an artifact claiming comparability it does not have.
- The profile sensitivity gate now destructures to the leaf. A field added to `Capabilities` or
  `BackendIdentity` is as output-affecting as one on `Profile`; a gate stopping at
  `capabilities: _` waved it straight through.
- The float ban was scoped to `quantize`'s body rather than the whole of `geom.rs`. The file-level
  skip was a hole big enough for `QRect` — which lives there, derives `Serialize`, and would have
  passed with an `f64` field. Verified by injecting one and watching the guard fire.
- `sort_ids` put a malformed id **first** while its doc claimed last, because `Option`'s natural
  order sorts `None` first. Now sorts last, with a test.

**Not done, deliberately**

- No PDF parsing, classification, or extraction (M2, M3).
- No grounding projection (M5).
- `oracle_agrees_on_simple_text` still fails with its M1–M6 diagnostic, as designed until M6.

### M0 — Repo skeleton, toolchain, deny policy, failing oracle harness

- Four-crate workspace with enforced boundaries; toolchain pinned to 1.88.0.
- `deny.toml`: allowlist-only licences (no AGPL), no network crates, pinned registry.
- `fixtures/manifest.json` — hash-pinned references into the Ethos corpus across two roots.
- Oracle harness with negative-path tests; `oracle_agrees_on_simple_text` fails by design.
- CI: fmt, clippy, build, test, deny, plus a job that *proves* the AGPL gate rejects.
